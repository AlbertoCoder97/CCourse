/* Other than arithmetical operators, in C there are bitwise operators that allow us to execute 
* math functions dealing with bits. They work mostly with unsigned ints. Bitwise operators are: 
* - and = &
* - inclusive or = | 
* - exclusive ore = ^ 
* - complement = ~ 
To not be confused and and or with && and ||. Single ones are bitwise operators and double ones are
* boolean operators. 

* There are also other types of operators called Shift operators. They are either Right-Shift or
* Left-Shift. Shifting a number right of one position means that you move all the bits on the right and
insert a 0 as the last bit. Same with left but to the left. Shift operators are:
* - Right-Shift = >> 
* - Left-Shift = << 
* A Right shift of n position equals to a division by powers of 2. Shift of one = division of 2^1 etc...
* Same with the left shift. */
